The tribute page was a difficult choice, but I finally settled on **Hedy Lamarr** as a subject.  
## Why I chose this subject?
She is quite an extraordinary woman with a life which could be the subject of a movie or quite a few episodes in an exciting TV series (which I believe is in the works).  
Apart from being a successful actress, speaking many languages perfectly, being presented as the most beautiful woman in Hollywood, she also was very clever and curious and tinkering away in trying to develop new techiniques and processes.  
This lead to a US patent filed in the 40ies which was the precursor of today's wifi/bluetooth and gps technologies.  
An interesting quote form her to see her character:  
>Hope and curiosity about the future seemed better than guarantees. That's the way I was. The unknown was always so attractive to me... and still is.

## What did I learn?
I had played around with html about 20 years ago and getting into it now was interesting as the basics are very similar but everything seems to be much more descriptive and organised.
* A review of **Html** basic framework
* I now have a better understanding of the use of **CSS** as a good way to organise and influence a page and easily make changes to repeated sections.
* Set up of **Git** and **Github**. This is not yet mastered as i do not yet get the push from my laptop to github instead using the github page upload as well as having downloaded github for desktop. 
* Managed to clean the Github repository but not the other way round
* Went through the training on _Freedcodecamp_ and persevering with it, easy to learn and enjoyable sections so far
* Learnt **Markdown** using the training exercise provided in the course which was easy to pick up so far
* Learnt **Line command** using the _line commander game_ provided in the course,very enjoyable and easy to pick up and a better appreciation of its utility
* Learnt a lot about my tribute subject and her tumultuous life

### Still need to learn
1. Interaction between Git and Github and the push / pull aspect
2. Developing the Github page. The template is set-up but not yet clear how to push the webpage created on it
3. Continue the Freecodecamp Responsive Web Design course (Applied accessibility and beyond)   

## Reflection on the journey so far
It is good to be pushed through a pre-course material that extensive. There is a lot there and not all of it is clear to me yet.  
I defintely learnt new things and enjoyed it.  
Without being accepted in the School of Code I would have been much slower in picking up this knowledge and I look forward to more knowledge and acceleration of my learning through he bootcamp participation.
